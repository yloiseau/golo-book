== Project Management

Many modern languages come with a dedicated, or _de facto_ standard, build and dependency management tool.
https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] has http://doc.crates.io/[Cargo],
https://clojure.org/[Clojure] has https://leiningen.org/[Leiningen],
https://www.haskell.org/[Haskell] has https://www.haskell.org/cabal/[Cabal], and so on.

Partly to not reinvent the wheel again, and partly due to the tight integration with the Java ecosystem, Golo has chosen to leverage tools existing in the Java world: Golo plug-ins for both https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] and https://gradle.org/[Gradle].
